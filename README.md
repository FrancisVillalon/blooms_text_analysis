# Blooms Project

This project was created to explore and determine if any significant relationship between job seniority, job pay etc. and concepts used in Bloom's Taxanomy.

This project is a work in progress.

# Background

Bloom's taxnomy was developed to provide a common language for teachers to discuss and exchange learning and assessment methods.

It is used by educators worldwide to derive specific learning outcomes and is also used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive
levels.
In addition to that, there are specific terms known as Bloom's Taxonomy Action Verbs that can be used to word a learning outcome or assessment in a way in which its complexity varies.

For example,

1. DEFINE Newton's First Law - The Bloom's Taxonomy Action Verb here is "Define" and this statement merely calls upon the readers memory to recall a fact. Hence, it is a low complexity task.
2. EXPLAIN Newton's First Law - The Bloom's Taxonomy Action Verb here is "Explain" and this statement adds another layer of complexity to the question by tasking the reader to not only be capable of rememebering the law but being able to understand the information described in the law.

As seen above, merely changing the Bloom's Taxonomg Action Verb in a statement can alter the complexity of a given task.

Making a connection to job postings, all job postings will have a list of task or responsibilities written in their posting.
These tasks or responsibilities will be of varying difficulty and complexity ,the language used in the statements used to describe these
tasks or responsibilities can then be analyzed to potentially reveal the relationship between the language used and the complexity of a given task.

Generally speaking, job listings that call for more complex and demanding tasks or responsibilities are likely to offer higher job positions and/or salaries compared
to job listings that call for less sophisticated tasks or responsibilities.

The hypothesis is therefore, the more complex the task defined in a job posting, the higher the job salary or position.

We can then use the concepts described in bloom's taxonomy to explore what defines a complex task and subsequently explore the relationship between
complex tasks in job postings and job compensation or position.

# Assumptions and Limitations
1. All job postings being analyzed will strictly be in english. Characters or words in other languages will be ignored.
2. The focus of the project is on Bloom's Taxonomy so other factors in determining the difficulty/complexity of a job will not be considered.
3. There does not exist a definitive list of blooms taxonomy terms and as such the list of terms defined in this project is by no means definitive
